# LunaLoop: Gamified Period Tracking App

**A privacy-first, gamified menstrual health application built for KMK3323 Human-Computer Interaction.**

## 📖 About The Project

**LunaLoop** is a high-fidelity smartphone application designed to address the lack of consistent menstrual tracking among university students. Traditional apps can be intrusive or lack motivation; LunaLoop solves this by combining gamification elements with a privacy-first local storage architecture.

This project was developed as part of the **KMK3323 Human-Computer Interaction** course (Semester 1 2025/2026) at UNIMAS, following a rigorous User-Centered Design (UCD) process from ideation to a fully functional Android MVP.

## ✨ Key Features

The app implements the following MVP features:

* **Gamification Engine:** A logic engine that awards XP for daily logging, featuring visual level-up notifications and unlockable badges to encourage consistency.
* **Privacy Mode:** A dedicated "Eye Icon" toggle on the dashboard that masks sensitive data instantly for use in public spaces.
* **Fast Daily Logging:** A streamlined tracking page for logging Flow, Symptoms, Mood, and Water in under 30 seconds.
* **Dynamic CycleWheel:** A dashboard visualization showing the current phase, day count, and fertility window.
* **Local-First Architecture:** All data is stored locally on the device to ensure privacy and offline functionality.
* **Smart Reminders:** Custom notifications for specific times (e.g., 8:00 AM) to prompt logging or warn of upcoming cycles.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This project utilizes a hybrid development approach to create a native Android APK:

* **Framework:** React (TypeScript)
* **Build System:** Capacitor
* **Development Environment:** Android Studio
* **AI Assistance:** Google AI Studio (Gemini 3.0 Pro) - Used for debugging state management and code generation.
